She would barely withstand a stoke on the neck, much less real sexual stimuli. Would probably get close to climaxing the moment you put it in.Easy: Twilight. Little experience, having only heard of sexuality in books. Because of this, she is rather experimental, but she's still rather clumsy and won't make it though a real rutting.Normal: Rainbow Dash. A trooper, albeit rather sensitive. Sure, she'll talk like she's going to make you cum fountains, but get her in the right places and she'll be desperately clinging to you like a howler monkey.Hard: Rarity. An experienced lady, knows her way around a man. Soft, plush, and a rather dirty talker, it's going to be a challenge to survive her bedroom.Very Hard: Applejack. Aggressive and strong, Applejack can pin anyone down and force herself on her victim. She's one of the dirtiest ponies around, so don't expect anything light from her, especially with an ass that strong.Nightmare: Pinkie Pie. Sex with her would be like describing a color to a blind man. Simply impossible. Time and space would be laughed at, physics would receive a pie in the face, and laws of nature are given an atomic wedgie. Afterwards, your body will never feel the same way again, while Pinkie giggles happily and exclaims, "Let's do that again!">>Anonymous 10/21/12(Sun)02:43No.5199961 Anonymous  10/21/12(Sun)02:43 No.5199961File: 1350801832338.png-(700 KB, 1423x2280, wall of brony mastubatory text.png)How long can you last reading this garbage?>>Anonymous 10/21/12(Sun)02:44No.5199963 Anonymous  10/21/12(Sun)02:44 No.5199963>>5199929>Fluttershy pulled the pin.>Isn't holding the spoon down.They are fucked.>>Anonymous 10/21/12(Sun)02:44No.5199967 Anonymous  10/21/12(Sun)02:44 No.5199967>>5199917>take Rarity too a racing horse show>she assumes it's an uppercrust orgy social>"There doesn't seem to be a line.
